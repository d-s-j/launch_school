The following code prompts the user to set their own password if they haven't done so already, 
and then prompts them to login with that password. However, the program throws an error. 
What is the problem and how can you fix it?

Once you get the program to run without error, does it behave as expected? 
Verify that you are able to log in with your new password.

password = nil

  new_password = gets.chomp
  new_password # remove unnecessary variable assignment
