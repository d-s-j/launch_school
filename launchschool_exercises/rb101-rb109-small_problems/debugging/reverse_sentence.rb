The reverse_sentence method should return a new string with the words of its 
argument in reverse order, without using any of Ruby's built-in reverse methods.

def reverse_sentence(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(' ')
  reversed_words = []

  i = 0
  while i < words.length
    reversed_words = words[i] + reversed_words
    i += 1

p reverse_sentence('how are you doing')
# expected output: 'doing you are how'

# Solution:
def reverse_sentence(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(' ')
  reversed_words = []

  i = 0
  while i < words.length
    reversed_words = [words[i]] + reversed_words # concatenate two arrays, not string + array
    i += 1

  reversed_words.join(' ')
